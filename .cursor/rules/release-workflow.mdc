# Release and Publishing Workflow

This document outlines how to release new versions of the "draft note" theme.

## Release Process

1.  **Run the release script:** From the local terminal, execute `npm run release`.
2.  **Script Actions:** The script, defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json), performs the following actions:
    - Bumps the patch version number (e.g., 0.0.1 -> 0.0.2).
    - Creates a Git commit for the version change.
    - Creates a new Git tag corresponding to the new version (e.g., `v0.0.2`).
    - Pushes the commit and the new tag to the remote GitHub repository.

## Automated Publishing

- **Trigger:** Pushing a new version tag (e.g., `v*`) to the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow.
- **Workflow File:** The automation is defined in [.github/workflows/release.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/release.yml).
- **Actions:** The workflow automatically builds and publishes the extension to two marketplaces:
  - Visual Studio Marketplace
  - Open VSX Registry

**Important:** Direct publishing from the local machine (`vsce publish`) has been disabled to prevent conflicts with the CI/CD pipeline.

## Changelog Management

- The public change history displayed on the marketplaces is managed through the [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md) file.
- Before running the release script, update this file with the details of the new version. The workflow will automatically package this file.
